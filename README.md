Cinematic Scoreboard: Evaluating Movie Quality Metrics
Critics vs People: why your 8-year-old cousin didn't like Citizen Kane

# Abstract
In the age of abundant cinematic content, distinguishing exceptional movies becomes a complex task. This project aims to demystify the intricate metrics used to assess movie quality. Our motivation stems from the challenge faced by viewers in selecting films that align with their preferences, given the varying opinions of critics, audiences, and commercial success. We intend to weave a narrative exploring how different quality metrics, such as box office performance, audience ratings, and critical reviews, interplay and influence movie perception. By analyzing these diverse indicators, our goal is to uncover patterns and anomalies that dictate a movie's success and recognition, thus offering a comprehensive view of what constitutes a 'good' movie in different spheres.

# Research Questions
How do box office revenues correlate with critical and audience ratings?
What patterns emerge when comparing award-winning movies with their ratings and commercial success?
How do genre and release period affect a movie's reception across different metrics?
Is there a significant discrepancy between critics' reviews and audience ratings?
Can we predict a movie's success based on early reviews and initial box office performance?
+
Comparative Analysis: Compare Metascores across different media to understand trends, such as the differences in critical reception between genres or over time.
Correlation Studies: Investigate correlations between Metacritic scores and other data, such as box office earnings for movies or sales figures for video games.
Predictive Modeling: Use historical Metacritic data to predict future trends or successes in media.


# Proposed Additional Datasets
IMDb Database: A comprehensive collection of user and critic ratings, reviews, and movie metadata for the top 1000 movies. We plan to use IMDb's dataset to enrich our analysis with extensive user-generated content.
Metacritic: An aggregation of reviews from respected critics; calculates a weighted average score, giving users a quick glimpse into the overall critical reception.
Award Data: Datasets listing major film awards (Oscars, Golden Globes, etc.), to study the correlation between critical acclaim and other metrics
?Financial Reports: Box office revenue data from sources like Box Office Mojo to assess commercial success.

# Methods
Data Management: Python's Pandas library will aid in data processing and analysis.
Data Size and Format: We anticipate dealing with large datasets, predominantly in CSV format.
Data Integration and Cleaning: Merging datasets from various sources, ensuring consistency and quality.
Statistical Analysis: Employing correlation analysis and regression models to explore relationships between different metrics.
Machine Learning: Using predictive models to forecast a movie's success based on early available data???
NLP/Topic modeling/ Sentiment Analysis???
