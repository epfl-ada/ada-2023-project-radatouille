## Abstract
*A 150 word description of the project idea and goals. What’s the motivation behind your project? What story would you like to tell, and why?*

```md
How can you easily chose a movie? Between the number of oscar nomination, the expert's review or even the box office revenue, there are so many different metrics... Each and every one has a different definition of success. For example, the movie "Fight club", considered nowadays as a cult movie, was a commercial failure when it was released, as the press was not very enthusiastic about it and the box office revenue was not exceptionnaly high. We propose to study the correlation between the different metrics of success of a movie, that can be simple numbers (box office revenue, number of oscar nominations, etc.) or more complex metrics (expert's review, public's review, etc.).

Number of words in the abstract: 113


## Research Questions
*A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.*
- Are the critics and the professionals in the movie industry aligned on the movies they like? (The oscar nominations are a good proxy for the professionals' opinion, as the movies are nominated by the "Academy", composed of professionals in the movie industry).
- Are the critics and the public generally aligned on the movies they like?
- Does a happy public means an high box office revenue?
- TODO: \<at least one question about the textual reviews\>
 

## Proposed additional datasets (if any):
*List the additional dataset(s) you want to use (if any), and some ideas on how you expect to get, manage, process, and enrich it/them. Show us that you’ve read the docs and some examples, and that you have a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant. It is your responsibility to check that what you propose is feasible.*
- On doit scrapper des données pour les reviews et les critiques depuis des sites comme IMDB ainsi que des sites de critiques de films (metacritics, rotten tomatoes, etc.). 
- On décide de jouer avec le top 1000 IMDB, qui contient 792 films de notre dataset, et parmi ces 792, 630 sont aussi sur metacritics.
