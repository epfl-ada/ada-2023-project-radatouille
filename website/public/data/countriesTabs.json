Given that this metric studies the difference between IMDb ratings and Metascore, a negative value here indicates that Indian films, especially those from the Bollywood sector, are generally rated higher by audiences than by critics. This could point to a cultural divide where the elements that make Bollywood films endearing to their large audience—such as song and dance, melodrama, and escapist narratives—may not translate into the critical acclaim on an international scale, leading to a lower Metascore.",
