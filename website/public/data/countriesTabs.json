These numbers suggest that Iranian films, while fewer in number (37 films), leave a strong impression, perhaps due to their unique storytelling and cultural authenticity.",

        "content": "The Indian film industry, with its heart in Bollywood, shows a notably negative OLS coefficient (-4.027). Given that this metric studies the difference between IMDb ratings and Metascore, a negative value here indicates that Indian films, especially those from the Bollywood sector, are generally rated higher by audiences than by critics. This could point to a cultural divide where the elements that make Bollywood films endearing to their large audience—such as song and dance, melodrama, and escapist narratives—may not translate into the critical acclaim on an international scale, leading to a lower Metascore.",

The negative coefficient suggests a consistent critical underestimation, possibly due to the formulaic and commercial nature of Hollywood's productions.",
